## 2026-10-14: suite_small_v1 calibration
ran: greedy-nearest on a handful of suite_small scenarios as a sanity check (not a result, no CIs).
result: w the first draft's magazines (8 short / 4 long) greedy stopped every threat, so the suite
couldn't separate methods. cut magazines to 3 / 2, sites to 2-3, threat speed to 40-80 m/s, then
locked v1. real per-method numbers come from the phase 2 harness.
conclusion:
next: phase 2, baselines + eval harness on suite_small_v1.
